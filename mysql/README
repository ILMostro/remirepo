MySQL
-----

Backport of latest fedora package (sometime latest version before rawhide)


Diff:
	- federated engine enabled at startup
	- innodb_plugin provided (must be enable in my.cnf)
	- archive, blackhole and federated engines not build as plugin
	- obsolete mysqlclient16
	- minimal test suite (full is too long to run)
	- comment: "MySQL Community Server (GPL) by Remi"
	- use upstream tarball
