# If symlinked or copied to /etc/httpd/conf.d/z-owncloud-access.conf
# (or any other name that is alphabetically later than
# 'owncloud.conf'), this file will permit access to the ownCloud
# installation from any client. Ensure your deployment is correctly
# configured and secured before doing this!
#
# If you SYMLINK this file, you can rely on the ownCloud package to
# handle any future changes in the directory or URL hierarchy; this
# file will always achieve the high-level goal 'allow access to the
# ownCloud installation from any client'. If you COPY this file, you
# will have to check for changes to the original in future ownCloud
# package updates, and make any appropriate adjustments to your copy.
