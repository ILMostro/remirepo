CURRENT
--------------------------------------
- Discuss the pdo_sqlite2 situation. Either split into two extensions,
  or research/implement alternatives. Currently configure does not
  implement this pdo driver. sqlite_*() should always exist/work

- Update notes/changelog to reflect (or inform) users of php-src changes
  since version 1.0.3

- Clarify that this extension exists for BC reasons, and is barely maintained

- Consider moving ext/sqlite bugs to the PECL bug tracker

OLD
--------------------------------------
- Implement a PDO driver, called sqlite2

- Transparent binary encoding of return values from PHP callback functions.

- Add user-space callback for the authorizer function (this is potentially
  very slow, so it needs to be implemented carefully).

- Add user-space callback to handle busy databases.

  o Test how robust we are when a user-space function is registered as
    a callback for a persistent connection in script A, then script B is
	called that doesn't register the callback but does make use of the
	function in an SQL query.
	--> Our test suite doesn't allow us to test persistent connections
	    at this time :/

- Use later version of built-in library
